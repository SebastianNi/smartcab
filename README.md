# Project: Train a Smartcab How to Drive
## My 4th Project in the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

### Link to the Udacity project repository

https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning/tree/master/projects/smartcab

### Project Overview
In this project I applied reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [PyGame](http://pygame.org/)

### Run

In order to run the code, you also need the files **\_\_init__.py**, **environment.py**, **planner.py** and **simulator.py**. You can find these files in the Udacity project repository linked in the beginning of this readme.

In a terminal or command window, run the following command:

```python agent.py```
